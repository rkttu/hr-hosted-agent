"""Hosted agent entry point — containerizes an Agent Framework agent for Microsoft Foundry.

This file is the ONLY file that matters for containerization. It takes your agent logic
and wraps it with the hosting adapter so Foundry can run it as a managed service.

HOW TO ADAPT THIS TO YOUR OWN AGENT:
    1. Replace the instructions (HR_INSTRUCTIONS) with your own agent's instructions.
    2. Replace/remove the context providers (AzureAISearchContextProvider) with whatever
       your agent needs — or use none if your agent doesn't need grounding data.
    3. Update the agent name and id to match your agent.
    4. The last line (from_agent_framework(agent).run()) NEVER changes — it starts
       the HTTP server on port 8088 that Foundry communicates with.

REQUIRED:
    - ChatAgent (not Agent) — the hosting adapter requires this class.
    - from_agent_framework() — wraps your ChatAgent into a Uvicorn HTTP server.
    - Sync DefaultAzureCredential (not async) — the adapter manages the async lifecycle.
    - Environment variables for configuration (set in deploy.py or agent.yaml, NOT .env).
"""

import os

# --- Azure identity (REQUIRED) ---
# Use the SYNC credential. The hosting adapter handles async internally.
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

# --- Agent Framework (REQUIRED) ---
# ChatAgent is the class compatible with the hosting adapter.
from agent_framework import ChatAgent

# --- Azure AI integrations (OPTIONAL — depends on your agent) ---
# AzureAIAgentClient: connects your agent to a Foundry project + model deployment.
# AzureAISearchContextProvider: gives your agent access to an Azure AI Search knowledge base.
# Remove or replace these if your agent uses different tools/providers.
from agent_framework.azure import AzureAIAgentClient, AzureAISearchContextProvider

# --- Hosting adapter (REQUIRED — this is what makes containerization work) ---
# from_agent_framework() wraps your ChatAgent into an HTTP server on port 8088.
# It exposes POST /responses (OpenAI Responses API) and GET /readiness (health check).
